This unit aims to address this gap by showing students how to identify, obtain, manipulate and analyse data to make informed business decisions. The nature of information used to inform decisions continues to change, in that big data, artificial intelligence or automation processes, alongside other competing data sources, may contribute to the information available to managers.
